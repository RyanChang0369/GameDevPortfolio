        <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
        <p>
          The existence of open-sourced software is perhaps one of the best
          arguments against the naturally selfish nature of humanity, and a
          surprising proportion of software is based on the labor of those who
          don't expect anything in return. But regardless of what particular
          philosophy you ascribe to the nature of man, open-sourced software
          development is what accelerated my interest in software development,
          and I have found that my natural curiosity and attention to detail
          made me excel in this field.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently a Senior majoring in Computer Science at MSU (Michigan
          State University), with a minor in Game Development. I have worked on
          various projects, including many that are already being used in the
          industry today. Check out some of those programs in the <a
          href="software_dev_projects.html">software development</a> section and
          in the <a href="game_dev_projects.html">game development</a> section.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of future aspirations, I only want to be able to continue to
          learn and progress, primarily in the realm of software development. I
          don't have any noble idea or plan of which I wish to use to better
          humanity. Perhaps I will re-evaluate my goals later in life, but for
          now, simply programming is sufficient for me. I enjoy having my ideas
          organized into working code, and I especially enjoy learning new
          programming paradigms, languages, even operating systems and more.
          When I'm not programming for my career or for my coursework, I'm often
          creating and perfecting various BASH scripts, developing some personal
          video game, or installing, configuring, and reinstalling Linux on
          random devices.
