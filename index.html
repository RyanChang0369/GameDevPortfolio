        <h1>Who Am I</h1>
        <p>
          I am a Senior majoring in Computer Science at MSU (Michigan State
          University), with a minor in Game Development. I have worked on a
          handful of school projects in game development, and I have a few
          unfinished personal projects that I used to learn the basics of Unity.
          In addition, I have developed a plethora of small scripts, mostly
          written in BASH, in my free time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in programming, starting in early high school, with over
          4 years experience specifically in C# and about 3 years experience in
          Unity. Through my experiences as a student, I have also gained
          proficiency in project management software, namely Trello, as well as
          source control software such as Git and Plastic SCM.
