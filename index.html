                    <h1>Who Am I</h1>
                    <p>
                        I am a Senior majoring in Computer Science at MSU
                        (Michigan State University), with a minor in Game
                        Development. I have worked on a handful of school
                        projects in game development, and I have a few
                        unfinished personal projects that I used to learn the
                        basics of Unity. In addition, I have developed a
                        plethora of small scripts, mostly written in BASH, in my
                        free time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I specialize in programming, starting in early high
                        school, with over 4 years experience specifically in C#
                        and about 3 years experience in Unity. Through my
                        experiences as a student, I have also gained proficiency
                        in project management software, namely Trello, as well
                        as source control software such as Git and Plastic SCM.
                    </p>
