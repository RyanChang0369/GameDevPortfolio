                        Neon Oasis is a fast-paced hack and slash game where
                        the player circles a massive boss, managing their fuel and
                        speed as they dash around obstacles and attacks while chopping
                        off parts of said boss. Brazenness is rewarded as fuel;
                        the only way to regain fuel and keep moving is to attack
                        the boss or by performing near misses with obstacles.

                        This was actually the first team where I was not the sole
                        programmer (in fact, the team consisted entirely of
                        programmers), and I learned how to integrate my code with those
                        of others in a reliable, efficient, and timely manner. I
                        was also able to learn and adopt more systems of coding
                        for Unity. For example, we used a more event-based model
                        for this project where previously I had relied on a manager
                        based model, which proved to make implementation much
                        more flexible.

                        Wolf in Ohio is a mission based survival/action game where the player
                        plays as a lost wolf stranded in the treacherous state
                        of Ohio. They must sneak around guard dogs in order to consume
                        sheep to gain energy, get an item to a goal, avoid being
                        mauled by the dogs, and more in order to escape to Michigan.

                        I worked as the sole programmer and was responsible for
                        some of my code's implementation in terms of game design.
                        I learned the importance of communication during this project,
                        and I improved my communication ability with non-programmer
                        members of my team in order for my code to be implemented
                        easily and most efficiently.

                        This game was released to much appraisal from MSU game dev
                        alumni, our classmates, and our instructors. It received a first place
                        ranking from the alumni and tied for first place on our instructors'
                        ranking.

                        Developed during a game jam while I was a member of
                        SpartaSoft, Submarine Seeker is a short
                        two minute game where the player commandeers a submarine
                        to collect sunken treasure at the bottom of the sea.

                        This was the first game I have developed to completion
                        and is the first game that I have developed in a team. I
                        designed the rotational style of movement for the player,
                        implemented the URP lighting system, including the radar
                        pings, as well as other various implementation details.
                        It was particularly well received by other members of
                        SpartaSoft.

                        Although this experience has little implications for improving
                        Unity or C# skills, it nevertheless was invaluable as a
                        real world experience in programming. I have applied many
                        skills that I have learned as a student, including using Trello
                        and other project management software, source control, and
                        having meetings with superiors in a non-classroom setting.
