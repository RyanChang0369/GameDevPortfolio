                    <h1>Who Am I</h1>
                    <p>
                        I am a Junior majoring in Computer Science at MSU, with
                        a minor in Game Development. I have worked on a handful
                        of school projects in game development, and I have a few
                        unfinished personal projects that I used to learn the
                        basics of Unity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I specialize in programming, starting in early high
                        school, with over 3 years experience specifically in C#
                        and about 2.5 years experience in Unity. Through my
                        experiences as a student, I have also gained proficiently in
                        project management software, namely Trello, as well as
                        source control software such as Git and Plastic SCM.
                    </p>
