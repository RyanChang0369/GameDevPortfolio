                    Although I have focused focused on game development, I also
                    have experience developing other software, mainly for
                    front-end systems. I have highlighted the best projects
                    below.

                <h2 id="cluml">clUML</h2>
                <img src="images/cluml.png" />
                <p>
                    clUML is a web-based UML editor developed for the Michigan
                    State University Computer Science program during the
                    capstone course at the aforementioned program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The capstone emphasized professionalism and communication
                    above everything else. As part of a small team of five
                    students, we learned how to communicate with corporate-like
                    clients and superiors. That includes how to hold
                    professional work meetings and how to ask for and understand
                    the client's vision of their product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, I have learned how to utilize Yarn and NPM for
                    Javascript package management, as well as using Node.JS for
                    deploying testing environments. In addition, this marks the
                    first time I have utilized Javascript in a more complex
                    project, which has helped tremendously in my understanding of
                    that language.

                <h2 id="coldfront">ICER Coldfront</h2>
                <p>
                    I have also worked as a student tech assistant for MSU's
                    <a href="https://icer.msu.edu/">Institute for Cyber-Enabled
                    Research</a> to develop improvements for their project
                    management tool
                    <a href="https://coldfront.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">
                        Coldfront
                    </a>. I was responsible for a variety of both front end and
                    back end tasks, including skinning the UI to fit MSU design
                    requirements and integrating project export and import.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As one of my first experiences in the professional side of
                    software development, this was an invaluable experience. I
                    was able to apply my skills to a real-world projects used by
                    real users. Such skills I was able to utilize includes
                    Trello and other project management software, source
                    control, and having meetings with superiors in a
                    non-classroom setting.
