                <p>
                    Below is a list of game development projects I have
                    completed as a team. They are listed in chronological order,
                    from most recent to least recent.

                <h2 id="salmon-run">Salmon Run</h2>
                <img src="images/sr_fish.png"/>
                <p>
                    Salmon Run is an educational game that simulates salmon
                    runs, where salmon migrate upstream in order to spawn. It
                    allows middle school students to learn about the effects of
                    environmental and man-made elements on the salmon
                    population, as well as their effects on the overall genetics
                    of the population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This marks the first project where I inherited an existing
                    project rather than creating one from scratch. As such, I
                    needed to be read and understand the existing code in order
                    to add additional features and make improvements. Throughout
                    my studying of the code, I learned a few concepts that I
                    didn't know about before. The most important concept learned
                    was the use of global events to avoid excessive amounts of
                    references. I also identified some areas of improvement, and
                    I made sure to confirm with my employers before making the
                    changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, I was tasked with implementing several complex
                    features, one of which was the implementation of save files.
                    As Salmon Run is a browser-based game, it cannot have direct
                    access to the user's computer. Therefore, some compromises
                    to my employers' original vision were required, and those
                    compromises were explained to my employers. We arrived at a
                    solution after a few discussions, which highlights the
                    improvements to my social skills over my career as a
                    student.

                    Shotgun Slime
                    <a href="https://ryanchang.itch.io/shotgun-slime" class="social itchio" target="_blank"></a>
                </h2>
                <img src="images/sgs_gameplay3.png" />
                <p>
                    In Shotgun Slime, you control a slime spawned from a nuclear
                    accident that has access to firearms. You play with your
                    friends in an endless, non-stop tournament, with multiple
                    weapons and levels. Your goal is to defeat the other
                    players' slimes and be the last slime standing at the end of
                    each round. Each level has a unique gimmick as well, ranging
                    from explosive barrels to death lasers. Weapons are designed
                    to reward risk-taking and constant movement, as well as
                    creativity to create combos with both equipped weapons. The
                    game can support up to four local players, and supports both
                    keyboard/mouse controls and gamepad controls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the development of Shotgun Slime, my team and I
                    focused on refining the game experience as much as possible.
                    We did so primarily through the usage of playtesting, where
                    we gathered feedback from other game developers in our
                    cohort. As a result, I gained valuable experience I can
                    apply to future playtesting sessions on other projects, as
                    well as a demonstration on the merits of playtesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, my experience from past projects had allowed me
                    to integrate with my team to a fuller degree, which avoided
                    some of the hiccups from previous projects. For example, I
                    have vastly improved my ability to explain to level
                    designers how to best utilize my code. This avoids issues in
                    the past where incorrect implementations of my code had lead
                    to difficult to find bugs.

                    Vegetarian Alligator Bandit
                    <a href="https://matuhg.itch.io/vab" class="social itchio" target="_blank"></a>
                </h2>
                <img src="images/vab_gameplay.png" />
                <p>
                    Vegetarian Alligator Bandit is a turn-based tactical RPG
                    where you lead five alligators on a mission to steal veggies
                    from a farmstead using a combination of stealth, combat, and
                    trickery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vegetarian Alligator Bandit showed me that proper planning
                    is important when developing games. Due to the rather large
                    scope of the project in relation to its development time, I
                    deemed it necessary to cut corners and forgo proper
                    planning. In addition, proper communication was not
                    established with my group mates, leading to me developing
                    code that was incompatible with the team's final vision of
                    the project. The consequence of this arose in the form of a
                    massive bug in the enemies' AI that was discovered hours
                    before the project was due.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project served to reinforce that which I had ignored,
                    that proper communication, planning, scope management, and
                    adequate playtesting is paramount to the continued success
                    of a project.

                <p>
                    Neon Oasis is a fast-paced hack and slash game where the
                    player circles a massive boss, managing their fuel and speed
                    as they dash around obstacles and attacks while chopping off
                    parts of said boss. Brazenness is rewarded as fuel; the only
                    way to regain fuel and keep moving is to attack the boss or
                    by performing near misses with obstacles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was actually the first team where I was not the sole
                    programmer (in fact, the team consisted entirely of
                    programmers), and I learned how to integrate my code with
                    those of others in a reliable, efficient, and timely manner.
                    I was also able to learn and adopt more systems of coding
                    for Unity. For example, we used a more event-based model for
                    this project where previously I had relied on a manager
                    based model, which proved to make implementation much more
                    flexible.

                    Wolf in Ohio is a mission based survival/action game where
                    the player plays as a lost wolf stranded in the treacherous
                    state of Ohio. They must sneak around guard dogs in order to
                    consume sheep to gain energy, get an item to a goal, avoid
                    being mauled by the dogs, and more in order to escape to

                    I worked as the sole programmer and was responsible for some
                    of my code's implementation in terms of game design. I
                    learned the importance of communication during this project,
                    and I improved my communication ability with non-programmer
                    members of my team in order for my code to be implemented
                    easily and most efficiently.

                    where you get to create your rails. Players drive a
                    high-speed bullet train with two guns: a railgun to shoot
                    enemies and a rail gun that shoots rails for the train to
                    drive on. They must balance firing the railgun and the rail

                <p>
                    This a procedural terrain generation demonstration using
                    the Unity job system and the Burst compiler. This allows me
                    to create multi-threaded code, which drastically improved
                    the performance of the terrain generation from traditional
                    single-threaded code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the generator supports customizable noise
                    profiles (called octaves) in order to fine-tune the overall
                    shape of the generated terrain. This allows for the creation
                    of rolling hills and sharp mountains, for example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the generator moves with the player, reusing old
                    terrain chunks by moving them so that the player remains
                    surrounded by terrain on all sides. This drastically
                    decreases memory utilization, all while maintaining the
                    illusion of an infinite world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan to improve this code over the summer, adding support
                    for biomes, trees, and surface materials.
